DEVELOPPER SIDE TASKS

- Add comments to your components to understand what they do and how they do it.
- Refactor code (change components' structure, components' name, folder structure, code reorganization, etc.).
- Remove unnecessary code, especially in CSS.

CLIENT SIDE TASKS

- Animation for when user clicks on CharacterCard (like card turning around).
- Change SoundButton component name (because the question mark button is not a sound button)
